You're welcome! I'm happy to help you with your project. Here's a step-by-step guide to install the necessary Node_modules:

Open your terminal

Install the Node_modules by running
**npm install**
or
**npm i**

This will install all the dependencies listed in your package.json file.

Once that's done, you should be ready to proceed with my project. If you have any other steps or specific instructions for the project, feel free to let me know!
